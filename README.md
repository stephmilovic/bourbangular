#Angular Shooters

This is a skeleton template using AngularJS, Bourbon and Neat, NodeJS, and ExpressJS(4) so you can just shoot it and Gulp. The skeleton is based on several Yeoman generators that I have used but did not like because I wanted to use a different task runner than Grunt, thus I used Gulp, and I wanted Bourbon and Neat right out of the box. 

This skeleton connects Bourbon and Neat through NodeJS and uses ExpressJS to allow you to create various routes you may need. Everything is connected through AngularJS, and I have also included UI Router so you would not have to. Firebase and Angularfire have also been included to transfer data to and from a database.

If you like the project, please use it. Just make sure to run ```npm install``` and ```bower install``` to get all the dependencies.

I will continue to work on this project. If you have any improvements, please fork and make a pull request.
