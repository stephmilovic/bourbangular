#Bourbangular

This is a skeleton template using AngularJS, Bourbon, Neat, Bitters, and Refills, NodeJS, and ExpressJS(4).

This skeleton connects Bourbon and Neat through Gulp and NodeJS and uses ExpressJS to allow you to create various routes you may need. Everything is connected through AngularJS, and I have also included UI Router so you would not have to.  

The current directory tree is as follows:

If you like the project, please use it. Just make sure to run ```npm install``` and ```bower install``` to get all the dependencies.

I will continue to work on this project. If you have any improvements, please fork and make a pull request.
